# FINAL
The fully homomorphic encryption scheme based on NTRU and LWE.

## Run the code

1. Install [NTL](https://libntl.org) and [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org) with the related dependencies.
2. Run `make` in the main repository folder.
3. Run the `test` program and check that all the homomorphic gates are computed correctly. 

## Usage

Use `test.cpp` and `Makefile` as reference points to create and compile your own program with FINAL.
